      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its a mix of imposter syndrome, so many ideas i dont know where to start, the worry of being &amp;ldquo;job interview ready&amp;rdquo; at any point, or what, but often i find myself overwhelmed and unsure of where to go next, what project i should be working on, what framework i should be learning&amp;hellip;
The world of computer science/programming/coding/etc. is so exciting and growing every day. So many talented engineers are off creating new things, improving on old concepts and making things faster/more efficient.</description>

      <description>These are my notes from learning about bitwise operators
&amp;amp; : AND Copies bit if it exists in both | : OR Copies bit if it exists in either ^ : XOR Copies bit if it exists in one but not the other ~ : One&#39;s Compliment Flip bits &amp;lt;&amp;lt; : Left Shift move left operand left by right operand number of bits &amp;gt;&amp;gt; : Right Shift move left operand right by right operand number of bits  Examples were easy to understand from a textual definition, but to see a visual, i wrote the following python code to show the binary versions.</description>
