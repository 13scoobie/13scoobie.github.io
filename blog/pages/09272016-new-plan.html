Changing this to 1 book a month - thinking about adding 1 language a month as well.
Unless i start working on the language and really get into it,
then it might end up lasting 2 months.

Started the first book - Pragmatic Programmer - from Journeyman to Master <br />
So far, so good. notes and reviews to come
