                    <p>Did my first code challenge in quite awhile yesterday evening. <a href="../../challenges/HackerRank/Arrays-Left-Rotation.html">Check it out</a></p>
                    <p>It was a lot of fun - forgot how much fun they are to do, and how accomplished you feel after you find a solution</p>
                    <p>My first solution was not the best (nested for loop), and so was not able to pass the challenge. After spending some time researching ways other people accomplished it, I was able to correct my code and re-submit for a winning solution</p>
                    <p>Looking forward to complete many more here in the near future and document what i struggled with, what i learned, and how i can be that much better going forward.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>Till next time,</p>
